# First Reflection
This Week I did a Digital Citizen Ship project and learn alot about internet Saftey and Digital Footprint
My topic was Digital Footprint 

- Topic: Digital Citizenship (Effects of Digital Footprints and how to protect them)
- Digital Citezen ship and Digital Footprint were not a new consept for me. I have learned about these topic many times before but this time I was tasked with going deeper into my knowledge about it. I looked at not only the effects of having a negative digital footprint but also some ways we can protect ours. One thing I learned that I didnt know before was that there are two types of digital footprint. One is the intentional things we post and the other are things downloaded onto your computer without you knowledge.
  
- What I struggled with: I struggled with finding creative ways to engadge the class. We wanted our presentation to be more then just helpful infomation from kahoot. We wanted to create a game that used real life example to show people how real this problem is. We made it so that people can see the real effects of a negative digital footprint on real celebrities. We saw great feedback from this as alot of people seemed suprised at what some celebrities said. We struggled to create the idea but overall I think our example helped give people a better idea of just how easily delete things can be found again.
  
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I am proud of the research that went into this project. Most website's list a basic definition of what a digital footprint is which made it hard to find extra information to make my project more detailed. As well I had a hard time finding ways to protect your digital footprint which ment I had to make my own. Overall I was still able to find good informartion and create an informational project. 
  
- Next steps:
