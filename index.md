cond # Hi, I'm Isabella
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I‚Äôll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- üîß Project 1: *(Digital Citizenship Presentation - Digital Footprint)* ‚Äì *(We focused on teaching our classmates how to be safe online and be a good digital citizen. We did so through fun games of trivia and real life celebrity examples to show people how being a bad digital citizen can effect you no matter who you are)*
- üß† Concept I learned: *(I learned alot about the different types of digital footprints from my project but I also learned alot about security from my classmates project. I learned about different types of scams and how to better protect my password. It opened my eyes to how I can wokr better to proyect my self online and how to protect my digital foot print )*
